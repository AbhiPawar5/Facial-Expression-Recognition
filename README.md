## About the dataset
FER13 is an open-source dataset which is first, created for an ongoing project by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, 
then shared publicly for a Kaggle competition, shortly before ICML 2013.

Source of Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

This dataset consists of about 28k images split into train and validation directory.
